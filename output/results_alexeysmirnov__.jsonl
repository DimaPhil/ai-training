Additionally, the trainer notes that the back often assists in 'cheating' the weight up, which further reduces biceps isolation.","correct_way":"The correct, more effective method involves a single-arm cable curl while sitting on the floor with the entire back of the upper arm resting on a flat bench. This position starts with the biceps in a stretched state, leading to high activation from the very first inch of movement.

This movement pattern causes significant overactivation of the upper trapezius and medial deltoid, thereby stealing the load from the intended target muscle, the posterior deltoid. For example, the myograph shows the upper trapezius peaking at approximately 1690 (at 0:09) and 1863 (at 0:19), while the posterior deltoid only reaches about 953 and 783 respectively. The medial deltoid also shows moderate but not optimal activation. This technique leads to less effective isolation of the posterior deltoid and excessive engagement of compensatory muscles.","correct_way":"The correct technique for targeting the posterior deltoid involves a precise setup and movement. The elbows should be slightly bent and rotated inwards. Crucially, the shoulders must remain depressed (not shrugging), and the shoulder blades should not be retracted during the movement. Instead of simply lifting outwards, the focus is on pulling the elbows back and almost along the body. This significantly reduces the involvement of the upper trapezius and medial deltoid, leading to much higher and more effective activation of the posterior deltoid. The myograph demonstrates this improvement, with posterior deltoid activation peaking as high as 2051 (at 0:31), while upper trapezius activation is substantially reduced (e.g., 830 at 0:31, compared to 1863 in the wrong way). Medial deltoid also shows improved, balanced activation (e.g., 1114 at 0:31).","trainer_insights":"To give the shoulder more volume and a rounded appearance from the back, it's essential to effectively train the posterior deltoid. The key is to isolate this muscle by minimizing the involvement of the upper trapezius and medial deltoid. When performing this exercise, ensure your elbows are turned inwards, your shoulders are kept down, and you do not retract your shoulder blades. Instead, focus on driving your elbows back, almost along your torso. This will maximize posterior deltoid activation and contribute to better shoulder development.

For example, the myograph readings show peaks as low as 84 for upper abs, 30 for middle abs, and 13 for lower abs, indicating minimal engagement. This is because the primary function of the rectus abdominis is spinal flexion (crunching/curling the spine), which is not performed with a straight back. Additionally, many users stand too far from the machine, causing them to rely on their body weight to move the cable, rather than engaging their abdominal muscles, further reducing effective activation.","correct_way":"The correct technique emphasizes spinal flexion, performing a \"twisting inwards\" or \"crunching\" motion. The body should be positioned closer to the machine to ensure the load is primarily moved by the abdominal muscles. The arms should act merely as \"hooks\" to hold the rope, not to pull it. The movement should be initiated by contracting the abs to curl the torso down, focusing on bringing the rib cage closer to the pelvis. This generates significantly higher muscle activation across all parts of the rectus abdominis. For instance, myograph readings demonstrate peak activations soaring to 1759 for upper abs, 1613 for middle abs, and 1725 for lower abs, which are dramatically higher compared to the incorrect method.

This minimizes initial biceps activation (e.g., as low as 28-50 units on the myograph). The movement involves extending the dumbbell forward and allowing the latissimus dorsi to fully stretch without retracting the shoulder blade. During the concentric phase, the elbow is driven downwards and brought close to the body, focusing on adducting the arm and contracting the latissimus dorsi.

This method is more effective because it isolates the abdominal and oblique muscles through a controlled range of motion, focusing on contraction rather than just lifting the torso.","trainer_insights":"The trainer advises against the old-school crunch method, highlighting its ineffectiveness based on the myograph readings. He demonstrates a more advanced reverse crunch variation where the legs are extended and brought back in a controlled manner, emphasizing that this increases the difficulty and thereby the stimulus on the obliques. He suggests that if the movement becomes too easy, extending the legs further and increasing the range of motion can enhance the challenge and strength stimulus. The key is to maintain tension and focus on the contraction of the oblique muscles."},"general_insights":null,"error":null}

This technique leads to a reduction in bicep activation, as indicated by the lower myograph readings for both the long and short biceps heads, and shifts the load to the forearms and shoulders. Specifically, the myograph shows significantly reduced activation for both biceps heads (e.g., 26 for short head vs. 249 for long head during the initial lift) and less overall engagement when the elbows move forward and the weight is thrown.","correct_way":"The correct technique focuses on keeping the elbows fixed at the sides and slightly behind the torso. The movement is controlled and isolated to the biceps, with a deliberate curl upwards and a slow, controlled lowering of the weight. This method maximizes muscle activation, as shown by the higher and more consistent myograph readings. For instance, during the proper execution, the short head activation can reach levels like 956 (compared to 32 for the wrong way), and the long head activation reaches 1849 (compared to 828 for the wrong way). The goal is to maintain tension on the biceps throughout the entire range of motion, avoiding momentum.","trainer_insights":"The trainer emphasizes three key errors: 1. Moving the elbows forward and backward, which reduces bicep engagement and shifts the load. 2. Using momentum or 'throwing' the weight up with the hips and back, which also decreases bicep focus. 3. Curling the bar too close to the body and using wrist flexion to lift, which overloads the forearms. The correct approach involves keeping the elbows stable, initiating the movement solely from the biceps, and maintaining control throughout the lift and eccentric phase. The trainer highlights that the goal is to keep the tension on the biceps, not to see how much weight can be lifted using momentum or other muscle groups. Proper form ensures maximum stimulation of the biceps for growth."},"general_insights":null,"error":null}

This position overloads the anterior deltoids and rotator cuff, while reducing the activation of the pectoralis muscles. The myograph data shows significantly lower activation for the upper, middle, and lower chest compared to the correct technique.","correct_way":"The correct technique involves a narrower grip, approximately shoulder-width apart. It's crucial to keep the shoulder blades retracted and down, maintaining a slight arch in the lower back and keeping the chest up and proud. The chest should lead the movement. The myograph data demonstrates a substantial increase in activation across all measured chest regions (upper, middle, and lower) when this technique is employed, with reported increases of over 100% in some areas.","trainer_insights":"To maximize chest activation, it's essential to set up the machine correctly by adjusting the seat height so the handles are in line with the mid-chest. Maintain a stable base by planting your feet firmly on the ground. The key is to achieve a chest-forward position by retracting the shoulder blades and slightly arching the lower back. Avoid letting the shoulders roll forward at the bottom of the movement. A closer grip, approximately shoulder-width, allows for greater chest engagement compared to a wider grip. The trainer suggests sets of 3-4 repetitions for 8-12 reps, with a focus on controlled eccentric (lowering) and explosive concentric (pressing) phases."},"general_insights":null,"error":null}
{"shortcode":"DQEvpuRCH6_","url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQEvpuRCH6_/","is_exercise_video":true,"exercise_analysis":{"muscle_group":"shoulders","machine":"dumbbells","wrong_way":"The incorrect technique involves lifting the dumbbells by largely swinging them upwards, using momentum rather than controlled muscle contraction. The elbows are kept too far forward, and the movement is initiated by pushing the weight up using the anterior deltoid and to some extent the middle deltoid. The myograph readings show significantly lower activation for the middle and posterior deltoids (e.g., middle delta: 301, posterior delta: 261 at 00:09) compared to the anterior deltoid. This indicates that the anterior deltoid is doing most of the work, while the other parts of the shoulder are underutilized.","correct_way":"The correct technique involves performing dumbbell shoulder presses with the elbows positioned slightly forward and tucked in, not flared out to the sides. The movement should be controlled, focusing on pressing the dumbbells straight up and controlling the descent. The trainer emphasizes keeping the elbows in this position to better engage the middle and posterior deltoids. The myograph readings demonstrate a significant improvement in activation for the middle deltoid (e.g., 942 at 00:11, 1402 at 00:30) and posterior deltoid (e.g., 258 at 00:09, 468 at 00:30) when this technique is used, while the anterior deltoid still shows good activation (e.g., 299 at 00:11, 1577 at 00:34).","trainer_insights":"The trainer advises keeping the elbows tucked in and supporting them against the body during the press. This helps to maximize the engagement of the middle and posterior deltoids. The incorrect method of using momentum and flaring the elbows leads to a significant drop in middle and posterior deltoid activation, while the anterior deltoid does most of the work. The trainer also mentions that the engagement of the anterior deltoid increases substantially with the correct technique, alongside the other deltoid heads. No specific sets, reps, or tempo were mentioned, but the focus is on proper form for optimal muscle activation."},"general_insights":null,"error":null}

This position also seems to involve excessive momentum and reduced focus on the back muscles. The myograph shows significantly lower activation for the latissimus dorsi (115-149) compared to the biceps (34-506) and triceps (14-179) during the most incorrect phase of the movement, indicating poor targeting of the intended muscle group.","correct_way":"The trainer shows performing the same cable pull-down exercise with a slight lean back, keeping the chest up and the back straight. The movement is controlled, bringing the bar down towards the upper chest and allowing for a full stretch at the top. This technique results in much higher and more consistent activation of the latissimus dorsi (peak of 1269 compared to biceps at 949 and triceps at 930 during a strong contraction phase), demonstrating optimal engagement of the target back muscles.","trainer_insights":"The trainer emphasizes that when performing the exercise with a forward lean, the load is not effectively transferred to the back muscles, leading to poor activation. Conversely, by leaning back slightly and initiating the movement by squeezing the shoulder blades together and pulling the elbows down, the latissimus dorsi becomes the primary mover. The trainer highlights that in the correct form, the load on the lats increases significantly (e.g., reaching 1000+ units compared to much lower values for biceps and triceps). The trainer advises to utilize this method to effectively work the back muscles."},"general_insights":null,"error":null}

The elbows are not fully extended at the peak contraction, and the descent is not controlled, leading to lower muscle activation. The myograph shows significantly lower readings for both the lateral (red graph) and long (yellow graph) triceps heads compared to the correct method. For example, at one point, the lateral head shows around 226 and the long head around 282, with peak activations even lower during repetitions.","correct_way":"The correct technique involves a full range of motion for overhead cable extensions. The user should fully extend the elbows at the top of the movement, pushing the weight upwards and slightly forwards. The descent should be controlled, allowing the triceps to stretch. This full extension and controlled movement maximizes muscle engagement, as evidenced by the myograph readings which show substantially higher and more consistent activation for both the lateral (red graph) and long (yellow graph) triceps heads. For instance, the lateral head reaches peaks over 1600 and the long head over 5700 during correct repetitions.","trainer_insights":"The trainer emphasizes the importance of a full range of motion and proper technique for maximizing triceps growth. The key is to extend the arms fully upwards and slightly forward at the peak contraction and to control the eccentric (lowering) phase. The trainer highlights that performing the exercise correctly, with proper extension and a controlled descent, leads to a significant increase in muscle activation (demonstrated by the myograph) compared to a shortened or less controlled range of motion. The video suggests performing 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions, focusing on the mind-muscle connection and maintaining tension throughout the movement."},"general_insights":null,"error":null}

This results in significantly lower activation of the posterior deltoid (red line) and trapezoid muscles (yellow line), with peak activation for the posterior deltoid reaching only around 736 and for the trapezoids around 391. The short range of motion limits the stretch and contraction of the target muscles.","correct_way":"The correct technique for reverse flyes focuses on the posterior deltoid. The user sits sideways to the machine, using a slight bend in the elbow. The movement involves a controlled abduction of the arm, bringing the handle outwards and backwards, focusing on squeezing the rear deltoid. This technique dramatically increases activation of the posterior deltoid, showing peaks up to 3383, and also engages the trapezoid muscles with higher activation, reaching peaks of 609. The range of motion is extended, allowing for a better stretch and contraction.","trainer_insights":"The trainer emphasizes that the wrong technique, common among many gym-goers, leads to minimal posterior deltoid activation. By changing the angle and using a bent elbow, the posterior deltoid can be targeted much more effectively. The trainer also points out that in the incorrect form, the trapezoid muscles compensate and take on more load. The correct technique increases posterior deltoid activation by 3.4 times and trapezoid activation by 2.4 times compared to the incorrect method. Recommended is to perform 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions. Focus on the mind-muscle connection, ensuring the posterior deltoid is doing the work, not the traps or lower back.

This also leads to the phenomenon of 'cheating' by using momentum. The myograph readings show lower activation for both the short and long heads of the biceps (e.g., 687 for short head, 1357 for long head at the peak of the movement) when the elbows are allowed to drift forward.","correct_way":"The correct technique involves keeping the elbows pinned to the sides of the body throughout the movement. The curl is performed by flexing the elbow joint only, lifting the barbell in a controlled arc towards the shoulders. The myograph readings demonstrate significantly higher activation for both the short and long heads of the biceps (e.g., 3333 for short head, 3794 for long head at the peak of the movement) when this strict form is maintained.","trainer_insights":"The trainer emphasizes maintaining strict form by keeping the elbows stationary and avoiding the temptation to swing the weight. He highlights that allowing the elbows to move forward significantly reduces the direct activation of the biceps muscles, particularly the long head which is targeted more effectively with strict form. The trainer also advises against 'throwing' the weight up, advocating for controlled movements and focusing on the mind-muscle connection. He suggests performing 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions for optimal hypertrophy."},"general_insights":null,"error":null}
